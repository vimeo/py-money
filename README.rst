Money class for Python 3. Unlike other Python money classes, this class enforces that all monetary amounts are represented with the correct number of decimal places for the currency. For example, 3.678 USD is invalid, as is 5.5 JPY.

Installation
============

Install the latest release with:

::

    pip install py-money

Usage
=====

A Money object can be created with an amount (specified as a string) and a currency from the Currency class.

.. code:: python

    >>> from money.money import Money
    >>> from money.currency import Currency
    >>> m = Money('9.95', Currency.GBP)
    >>> m
    GBP 9.95

Money is immutable and supports most mathematical and logical operators.

.. code:: python

    >>> m = Money('10.00', Currency.USD)
    >>> m / 2
    USD 5.00
    >>> m + Money('3.00', Currency.USD)
    USD 8.00
    >>> m > Money('5.55', Currency.USD)
    True

Money will automatically round to the correct number of decimal places for the currency.

.. code:: python

    >>> m = Money('9.95', Currency.EUR)
    >>> m * 0.15
    EUR 1.49
    >>> m = Money('10', Currency.JPY)
    >>> m / 3
    JPY 3

This is entirely configurable and can be disabled by calling ``set_rounding_per_operation`` on the ``Money`` class.

Money can be formatted for different locales.

.. code:: python

    >>> Money('3.24', Currency.USD).format('en_US')
    '$3.24'
    >>> Money('9.95', Currency.EUR).format('en_UK')
    '€5.56'
    >>> Money('94', Currency.JPY).format('ja_JP')
    '￥94'

Money does not support conversion between currencies and probably never will. Mathetmatical and logical operations between two money objects are only allowed if both objects are of the same currency. Otherwise, an error will be thrown.

Money will throw an error if you try to construct an object with an invalid amount for the currency (eg, 3.678 USD or 5.5 JPY).

Is this the money library for me?
=================================

If you're just trying to do simple mathematical operations on money in different currencies, this library is probably perfect for you! Perhaps you're just running a store online and you need to compute sales tax.

.. code:: python

    >>> subtotal = Money('9.95', Currency.USD)
    >>> tax = subtotal * 0.07
    >>> total = tax + subtotal
    >>> subtotal.format('en_US')
    '$9.95'
    >>> tax.format('en_US')
    '$0.70'
    >>> total.format('en_US')
    '$10.65'

All rounding will be done correctly, and you can open up in multiple countries with ease!

If you're doing complicated money operations that require many digits of precision for some reason (or you're running a gas station and charging that extra nine tenths of a cent), this library is not for you.

A word of warning: rounding is performed after each multiplication or division operation. While this is exactly what you want when computing sales tax, it may cause confusion if you're not expecting it.

.. code:: python

    >>> m = Money('9.95', Currency.USD)
    >>> m * 0.5 * 2
    USD 9.96
    >>> m * (0.5 * 2)
    USD 9.95
    >>> m * 1
    USD 9.95

To avoid confusion, make sure you simplify your expressions!

Future improvements
===================
Support may be added one day for setting rounding modes. Foreign exchange rates will probably never be supported.
